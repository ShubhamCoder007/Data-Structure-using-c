# Data-Structure-using-c
Popular data structure problem implementations using c with all the popular operations. Carefully crafted code for all my enthusiastic friends who wants to have a good hold and understanding of Data Structure using c. I have taken special effort for you all so that you can get the concepts clearly. Please do give feed back and things that you want to be included as well. Ask me if you have any query. The programs are crafted as close as to the industrial atmosphere, of course there might be a bit of cloudy comprehension, and if that's the case then do ask me. I'll try to help the best I can. Thank you
